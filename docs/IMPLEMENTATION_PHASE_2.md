# PHASE 2: CODE QUALITY & ARCHITECTURE ENHANCEMENT

> **Priority: HIGH** | **Timeline: 5-7 days** | **Status: PENDING**

---

## üéØ PHASE OBJECTIVES

1. **Component Refactoring** - Break down large files into focused components
2. **State Management Optimization** - Streamline data flow and reduce complexity
3. **Code Organization** - Implement consistent patterns and structure
4. **Documentation Enhancement** - Ensure maintainability and knowledge transfer
5. **Architecture Standardization** - Establish clear patterns for future development

## üìã DETAILED TASK BREAKDOWN

### 1. Component Refactoring
**Priority:** HIGH | **Estimated Time:** 8 hours

**Large Files Identified for Refactoring:**
- `src/components/review/NativeReviewViewer.tsx` (416 lines)
- `src/index.css` (298 lines)
- `docs/README-B√çBLIA.md` (448 lines)

**Refactoring Strategy:**
- Extract reusable components
- Separate concerns (UI, logic, data)
- Create focused, single-responsibility modules
- Maintain exact functionality during refactoring

### 2. State Management Optimization
**Priority:** HIGH | **Estimated Time:** 6 hours

**Current Issues:**
- Redundant state management across components
- Unnecessary re-renders
- Complex prop drilling patterns

**Optimization Plan:**
- Implement React.memo strategically
- Optimize context usage
- Reduce state complexity
- Implement proper memoization patterns

### 3. Code Organization
**Priority:** MEDIUM | **Estimated Time:** 4 hours

**Organization Improvements:**
- Consistent file naming conventions
- Proper import/export patterns
- Clear folder structure
- Remove dead code and unused imports

### 4. Documentation Enhancement
**Priority:** MEDIUM | **Estimated Time:** 3 hours

**Documentation Tasks:**
- Update component documentation
- Add inline code comments
- Create usage examples
- Update API documentation
