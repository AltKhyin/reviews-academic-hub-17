## Current Implementation Phase: Database Performance Optimization

### Completed Steps:
- âœ… Performance monitoring system implemented
- âœ… RPC performance tracking established
- âœ… Database optimization utilities created

### In Progress:
- ðŸ”„ Database performance baseline establishment
- ðŸ”„ Critical RLS policy optimization

### Next Steps:
1. Execute RLS policy optimization
2. Implement missing foreign key indexes
3. Frontend code splitting implementation
4. Schema normalization for issues.authors

### Performance Baselines (To Be Established):
- Query execution times
- RLS policy evaluation overhead
- Frontend bundle sizes
- API response times

### Implementation Notes:
- All changes are being made with surgical precision
- No UI modifications unless explicitly required
- Focus on performance and security improvements only
