# Performance Analysis Round 2 - Implementation Phase

## Database Performance Monitoring Implementation

### RPC Performance System
- Implemented comprehensive RPC call tracking
- Real-time performance metrics collection
- Query performance comparison tools
- Automated performance alerting

### Key Metrics Being Tracked:
1. **RLS Policy Performance**
   - Policy evaluation times
   - auth.uid() call frequency
   - Query plan analysis

2. **Index Usage Analysis**
   - Foreign key join performance
   - Scan vs. index usage ratios
   - Query optimization opportunities

3. **Frontend Performance**
   - Bundle size analysis
   - Route loading times
   - API call optimization

### Implementation Status:
- âœ… Performance monitoring hooks created
- âœ… Database optimization utilities implemented
- âœ… RPC performance tracking system active
- ðŸ”„ Baseline data collection in progress

### Next Implementation Priority:
Focus on RLS policy optimization as identified in the linter reports, followed by foreign key indexing.
