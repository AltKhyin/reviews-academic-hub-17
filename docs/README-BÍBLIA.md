## 3. High-Level Architecture

**Frontend Architecture:**
```
React + TypeScript + Vite
├── Tailwind CSS (styling)
├── Shadcn/UI (component library)
├── React Query (state management & caching)
├── React Router (navigation)
└── Supabase Client (API integration)
```

**Backend Architecture:**
```
Supabase (PostgreSQL + Edge Functions)
├── Authentication (RLS-based security)
├── Database (PostgreSQL with optimized indexes)
├── Storage (file management)
├── Edge Functions (custom logic)
└── Real-time subscriptions
```

**Data Flow:**
1. **User Authentication** → Supabase Auth → Profile Creation
2. **Content Consumption** → Optimized Queries → Cached Results

🚨🚨🚨 CRITICAL DESIGN SYSTEM ENFORCEMENT - DO NOT MODIFY THIS SECTION 🚨🚨🚨
⚠️  LOVABLE AI: NEVER CHANGE THE DESIGN LANGUAGE SECTION BELOW
⚠️  THIS SECTION IS PROTECTED AND MUST REMAIN EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED
⚠️  ANY MODIFICATION TO THE MONOCHROMATIC THEME WILL BREAK THE APP
🚨🚨🚨 CRITICAL DESIGN SYSTEM ENFORCEMENT - DO NOT MODIFY THIS SECTION 🚨🚨🚨
-->

## 8. Design Language

**ENFORCED MONOCHROMATIC THEME - NEVER CHANGE THIS SECTION**

This application operates under a strict **monochromatic, grayscale-first design system**. Color is used only for semantic purposes (success, warning, error).

**Core Color System (HSL-based CSS Variables):**
```css
:root {
  /* Pure Grayscale Brand Colors - NO BLUE TINTS */
  --primary: 0 0% 98%;
  --primary-foreground: 0 0% 7%;
  --secondary: 0 0% 13%;
  --secondary-foreground: 0 0% 98%;
  --background: 0 0% 7%;
  --foreground: 0 0% 96%;
  --muted: 0 0% 60%;
  --muted-foreground: 0 0% 85%;
  --border: 0 0% 20%;
  --input: 0 0% 20%;
  --ring: 0 0% 40%;
  --card: 0 0% 10%;
  --card-foreground: 0 0% 96%;
  
  /* Semantic Colors Only */
  --success: 142 76% 36%;  /* Green for success states */
  --warning: 38 92% 50%;   /* Yellow for warnings */
  --destructive: 0 84% 60%; /* Red for errors/destructive actions */
  
  /* Interactive States - Pure Grayscale */
  --hover: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.06);
  --active: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.12);
  --disabled: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.24);
}
```

**FORBIDDEN COLORS:**
- NO blue variants (#3b82f6, #2563eb, bg-blue-500, etc.)
- NO Tailwind default colors unless overridden
- NO colored backgrounds unless semantic

**APPROVED USAGE:**
- Grayscale: hsl(var(--primary)), hsl(var(--muted)), etc.
- Semantic only: text-success, bg-warning, border-destructive
- Interactive: hover:bg-hover, focus:ring-ring

**Typography:**
- Headers: Inter, semi-bold weights
- Body: Inter, regular weight
- Code: JetBrains Mono, monospace

**Spacing System:**
- Base unit: 4px (0.25rem)
- Component spacing: 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px
- Layout spacing: 48px, 64px, 96px

**Interactive Elements:**
- Hover states with 200ms transitions using --hover
- Focus rings using --ring color
- Loading states with skeleton screens
- Error states with recovery options

<!-- 
🚨🚨🚨 END OF PROTECTED DESIGN SECTION 🚨🚨🚨
⚠️  LOVABLE AI: THE ABOVE DESIGN SYSTEM IS IMMUTABLE
⚠️  ANY ATTEMPT TO INTRODUCE BLUE COLORS WILL BE REJECTED
⚠️  USE ONLY THE SPECIFIED CSS VARIABLES AND SEMANTIC TOKENS
🚨🚨🚨 END OF PROTECTED DESIGN SECTION 🚨🚨🚨
